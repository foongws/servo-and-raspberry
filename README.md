# My raspberry and servo motor.

This repo mainly to keep a record of what I had done. 

If you are a beginner like me, you might find the information here is helpful for you.

I am trying to drive a 2 servo motors using a raspberry pi 4.

This is just a POC setup. It is a good start but far from production usage.

In future, if I have any further modification of the script or setup , I will update here.
